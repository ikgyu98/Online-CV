## Possible Improvements

**Improvements:**
- The evaluation of the effectiveness was simply substantiated by the visual assessment.
- South Korean COVID data were very inconsistent. Therefore, the numbers could be slightly off.
- Perhaps, the methodology utilized in the assessment by itself could be incorrect. 

**How:**
- Evaluation would need a valid, precise means of verification. Rather than a simple visual assessment, I could incorporate statistical computation. 
- Considering the inconsistency, more data in a consistent format could be a great source of substantiation.
