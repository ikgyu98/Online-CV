## General Information

The Final Project in this course is the creation of a single Shiny app or dashboard in R. Students are not allowed to work together on the final project. This Shiny app or dashboard is an opportunity for students to demonstrate the statistical data management concepts - including tool-making, accessing and importing data, cleaning and validating data, and data visualization - that they have learned this semester and apply them along with version control for collaboration. Your ideas and coding must be your own code.

The Shiny app or dashboard may be based on any datasets (that had a data description) that were used in labs, homework, or the midterm exam. No other datasets are allowed. It is reasonable to make a Shiny app or dashboard that focuses on only one dataset. If students want their Shiny app or dashboard to work with multiple dataset or user-specified datasets (with URLs) then that is also acceptable.

## Minimum Requirements

The Shiny app or dashboard should only use data with a URL. There must be at least 1 data visualization and at least 1 summary table or tibble returned.

- Start & End Date
  - 02/26/2022 ~ 04/09/2022 (7 weeks)

- What problem does it (intend to) solve? | What is the purpose of your project?
  - Music shuffling systems of many major streaming services never had provided me satisfactory results. Here, we have decided to build an algorithm of our own which does not simply recommend songs that of similar genre & artist, but actually analyzes the musical feature of your choice of song **(input)** and recommends you the song **(output)** that shares similar musical characteristics.

- Brief explanation of your approach
  - We have attempted to find similarities among many different songs through their musical chord; however, chord processes were not sufficient in representing complexity of a music. Here, through researches, we were able to find Python libraries that provide sophisticated musical trait: Librosa and Spotipy. With that, after a week of research in scholaric articles, we were able to narrow variables down, then ended up with satisfactory classification result
