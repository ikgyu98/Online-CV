## Abstract

To understand infectious disease dynamics, one must identify social and biological sources of host heterogeneity. The human host is highly complex, not just at the molecular level but also in terms of social and behavioral dynamics. This has been especially clear for SARS-CoV-2, with disparities in exposure, infections, deaths, and vaccination across socioeconomic groups. Using publicly available data from over a dozen countries across all inhabited continents, we examine temporal trends of vaccination rates across socioeconomic groups at different spatial levels and identify common trends. Based on these observed trends, we implement a process-based model that incorporates socioeconomic information through host heterogeneity in the risk of infection, risk of dying due to severe disease, and probability of becoming vaccinated. With this model, we explore the consequences of social disparities, and compare strategies across countries to optimize vaccination efforts so that incidence and mortality. Our results generate insights that can influence policy and human behavior, and inform dose allocation strategies to reduce the burden of disease for communities with low socioeconomic status.
