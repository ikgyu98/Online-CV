# STAT 440 Statistical Data Management
### Spring 2022 Final Project

## General Information

The Final Project in this course is the creation of a single Shiny app or dashboard in R. Students are not allowed to work together on the final project. This Shiny app or dashboard is an opportunity for students to demonstrate the statistical data management concepts - including tool-making, accessing and importing data, cleaning and validating data, and data visualization - that they have learned this semester and apply them along with version control for collaboration. Your ideas and coding must be your own code.

The Shiny app or dashboard may be based on any datasets (that had a data description) that were used in labs, homework, or the midterm exam. No other datasets are allowed. It is reasonable to make a Shiny app or dashboard that focuses on only one dataset. If students want their Shiny app or dashboard to work with multiple dataset or user-specified datasets (with URLs) then that is also acceptable.

## Minimum Requirements

The Shiny app or dashboard should only use data with a URL. There must be at least 1 data visualization and at least 1 summary table or tibble returned.
